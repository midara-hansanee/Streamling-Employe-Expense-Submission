# Streamling-Employe-Expense-Submission
We developed a Power Automate workflow to streamline the employee expense submission and approval process, making it faster, more transparent, and less manual.

ðŸ”¹ Project Flow Overview:

Employees submit an Expense Approval Request through Microsoft Forms.

The Financial Manager is immediately notified via Microsoft Teams or email about the new request.

The Financial Manager can approve or reject the request directly from the notification.

If there is no response within a certain timeframe, the request is automatically escalated to the Financial Accountant via Teams or email.

Once a decision is made, the employee is notified of the outcome via email.

All approved requests are automatically updated in a SharePoint list for easy tracking and future reference.
